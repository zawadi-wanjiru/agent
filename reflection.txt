Reflection: Multi-Agent vs Single Agent Approach

When I started this project I honestly wasn't sure if having multiple agents would be worth the extra complexity. After building it though, I can see some clear advantages.

The biggest win is specialization. My Researcher agent is really good at searching FAQs because that's ALL it does. Same with the Order Specialist - it just looks up orders and nothing else. When I tried building a single-agent version earlier (before this lab), it would sometimes confuse return policies with shipping info, or try to look up an order when the customer just asked a general question. With specialized agents, each one stays in its lane and does its job well. It's like having actual team members who are experts vs one person trying to remember everything.

The Quality Reviewer agent is probably my favorite part. Having a separate agent review responses before they go out caught a bunch of issues - times when the Researcher would just dump the raw FAQ text instead of making it friendly, or when responses were too long. A single agent can't really critique its own output as well because it's already committed to that answer. The reviewer acts like a fresh pair of eyes. In a real customer service team you'd have someone checking messages before they send them out, so this mirrors that.

The main downside is definitely coordination overhead. Getting 6 agents to work together smoothly was tricky - I had to be really careful about what information each agent needs from the previous ones. And initially it was slow, which is why I added the routing optimization to skip agents that aren't needed. With a single agent you don't have that overhead. But I think for a real production system, the improved accuracy from specialization is worth the extra setup time.

One thing that surprised me: having multiple agents made debugging way easier. When something went wrong I could see exactly which agent messed up instead of trying to figure out why one massive agent gave a bad answer. It's like the difference between debugging a 1000-line function versus five 200-line functions - the smaller pieces are just easier to work with.
